export const HOME_HEADER = "In Progress Products";
export const SEARCH_HEADER = "Products Search Result";

Read me :- Use the same landingpage WS and test the react data grid for search page

in productpendinginitiation.jsx render method I can see the props.products that are passed in but the grid is not pulling the data
